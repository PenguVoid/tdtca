TODOO:

- Basic Mechanics of the Skilltree
    > Basic locking of features / mods
        * locking mods and features down and adding a dependency
    > Adding the Skilltree into Betterquesting for a user interaction
        * creating an interactable concept and designing it
        * making it user friendly and easy to understand (totaly trying to teach kids how rockets work)

- adding mods (enhancing gameplay experience and features)
    > Adding and removing mods depending on their condition and fit

- Configs and balancing (when possible)
    > Configuring mods to the needs of the Modpack
        * doing some first adjustments
        * getting things ready to get testet out in gameplay
    > Balancing and Flatening everything out for a better fit (Whoops! wrong hole!)
        * trying to get things more refined and changing things respectivly to the testing phase

- Testing
    > Debugging the shit out of this mess (who likes some cockroaches in their salad?)
        * speeks for itself... no really it does.
    > Getting a grasp of the general experience and refining it down to the needed resault
        * adding and removing mod / edit configs accordingly
        * more testing more debugging and repeated untill happy (if happynes is even a thing)

- Creating a Lore
    > Writing and Discussing the general idea of the story and writing it down
        * comming up with a general concept of the story
        * getting some ideas on the story progression / path
    > Evolving it into a Larger and more complex piece that fits General needs
        * Basic Peace of shit evolves into .... a usable piece of shit... i meant story
        * more refining and adding until the piece is done
    > splitting it up and make view point for different story experiences
        * creating the different view points and what they might change
        * more adding and refining but for the view point this time (what a suprise)
        * discussing and sharing ideas and getting a grasp of cross pathing the story
        * again more adding and refining.. can we do something else dad? ... no! and now screw of u little piece of shit
        * rince and repeat until it's done

- Doing the Voicelines
    > Embarrasing ourselfes with out terrible story telling skills
        * IMPORTANT. taking breaks and doing things in bite sized pieces
        * coffee and cake party.
    > Getting used to the process and refining things up
        * name says it all. refining the voice usage to make for a more immersive story experience
        * maybe getting some extra voices in
